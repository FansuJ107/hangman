# Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. Main learning points are being able to use basic Python coding to create the Hagman game as well as using Github as a repository.
